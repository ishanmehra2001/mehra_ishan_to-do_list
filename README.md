# Project Name - CSS CASCADE, SELECTION & PSEUDO SELECTORS (via preparing a To Do list)


## Description - My assignment of To-Do list contains Task Lists for all the FIPs of courses, which can provide me an idea that where i am on a specific project and i can even mark the things up which are done or in progress for example. This would result into better understanding of my milestones and progress. 


## Technology used - For all the FIPs, i have been using the softwares namely Adobe XD, Photoshop, Git Hub, Visual Studio Code and other media creating softwares. Also, for betterment of my schedule and timeline, i use Google calendar, Notion (for project management), and prepared timeline for each FIP.
